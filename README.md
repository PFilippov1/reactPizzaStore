# reactPizzaStore
I embarked on my React journey by crafting a pizza-ordering application.  
Leveraging the Redux Toolkit for state management, I fetched pizza data from mockapi.io to populate a dynamic and interactive user interface.   
This project was a valuable opportunity to solidify my understanding of: React components and hooks
Redux for efficient state management
API interactions and data fetching
Building responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
